# Elasticsearch-KNN
Brown bag talk I gave to show off how to use elasticsearch's relevance metric as the distance for k-nearest neighbors and do some very simple machine learning

Gave this presentation to demo ElasticSearch to the team as well as show off the basic steps in machine learning 

The [Powerpoint Presentation](ElasticSearch%20ML.pptx) has the slides I used during the talk

Sample code is [here](elasticsearch_ml.py)

With some background information on data basic cleaning [here](cleaning.py)
